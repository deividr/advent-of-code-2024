# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** repository! This project contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024), a series of programming puzzles released daily from December 1st to December 25th.

## Project Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ day01
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.go
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ input.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ day02
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.go
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ input.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

- Each `dayXX` directory corresponds to a day's puzzle.
- Files:
  - `main.go`: Solution to both parts of the day's puzzle.
  - `input.txt`: The puzzle input for that day.

## Technologies Used

- **Golang**: For implementing solutions.
- **Git**: Version control to track progress.

## How to Run
